`prettyping` is a wrapper around the standard `ping` tool with the objective of
making the output prettier, more colorful, more compact, and easier to read.

`prettyping` runs the standard `ping` in the background and parses its output,
showing the ping responses in a *graphical* way at the terminal (by using
colors and Unicode characters).

`prettyping` is written in `bash` and `awk`, and is reported to work on many
different systems (Linux, Mac OS X, BSDâ€¦), as well as running on different
versions of `awk` (`gawk`, `mawk`, `nawk`, `busybox awk`).

screenshots, videos at: <http://denilsonsa.github.io/prettyping/>

Requirements
------------

* `bash` (tested on 4.20, should work on versions as old as 2008)
* `awk` (either [gawk][], [mawk][], [nawk][] or [busybox awk][]; should work on
  `gawk` versions as old as 2008; should probably work on any other awk
  implementation)
* `ping` (from `iputils`, or any other version that prints essentially the same
  output, like Mac OS X ping or [oping][])
* Optional dependency on `stty` or `tput` to auto-detect the terminal size.
* Optional dependency on `play` from the `sox` package to play audible pings.

Installation
------------

1. Download [prettyping][] script and save it anywhere.
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x prettyping`

That's all! No root permission is required. You can save and run it from any
directory. As long as your user can run `ping`, `bash` and `awk`, then
`prettyping` will work.

Alternatively, you can download the latest tarball from GitHub: [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/denilsonsa/prettyping.svg)](https://github.com/denilsonsa/prettyping/releases/latest)

For people building a `prettyping` package (for any Linux distro or for Mac OS
X), just install the `prettyping` script into `/usr/bin/`, or whatever
directory is appropriate. No other file is necessary.
